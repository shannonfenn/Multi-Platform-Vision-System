 @brief Declaration of IKFModel interface class

 @class IKFModel
 @brief This class is an interface template for a model used in a kalman filter.

 The IKFModel contains two equations, the process equation used to update the current predicition during the time update. Also the
 measurement equation used to calculate the predicted measurment from the estimated state of the system.

 The processEquation and measurementEquation virtual functions must be defined for each implemented model.
