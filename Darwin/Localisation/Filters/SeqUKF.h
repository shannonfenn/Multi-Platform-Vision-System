 @brief Declaration of general WSeqUKF class

 @class WSeqUKF
 @brief This class is a template to create a custom WSeqUKF specific for an application.

 The WSeqUKF is a Sequential Unscented Kalman filter, where measurement updates are able to be performed
 sequentially rather than in parallel, while still returning the identical numerical results.

 The processEquation and measurementEquation virtual functions must be defined for each application,
 the remainder of the algorithm is otherwise identical.
