 @brief Declaration of general SeqUKF class

 @class SeqUKF
 @brief This class is a template to create a custom SeqUKF specific for an application.

 The SeqUKF is a Sequential Unscented Kalman filter, where measurement updates are able to be performed
 sequentially rather than in parallel, while still returning the identical numerical results.

 The processEquation and measurementEquation virtual functions must be defined for each application,
 the remainder of the algorithm is otherwise identical.
