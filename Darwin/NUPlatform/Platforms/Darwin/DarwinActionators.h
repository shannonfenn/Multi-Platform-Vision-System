    @brief Constructs a nubot actionator class with a Darwin backend
        The Darwin backend takes aspects from both the NAO and the Robotis
        backends; the Darwin has a secondary board to perform all the
        communication with hardware, like the NAO. However, it also uses
        Robotis motors, like the Cycloid/Bear.

        This backend is also the most recent, and probably should serve as a
        template for future platforms.
