    @file     ConfigStorageManager.h
    @brief     This is the header file for the storage manager of the configuration system for the NUbots.
 
    @class     ConfigStorageManager
    @brief     Manages persistant storage of configuration data (i.e. 
               reading/writing ConfigTrees to/from disk).
    
    All JSON is parsed to the ptree as strings. Conversion occurs elsewhere; this file is just to store
    the values in the tree. Will read each file individually and store it in the ptree (only storing
    strings).
