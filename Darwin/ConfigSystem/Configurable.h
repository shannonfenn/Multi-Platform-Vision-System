/*! @file Configurable.h
    @brief This file contains the definition of the Configurable interface for
           the Configuration module.
    
    @class Configurable
    @brief Defines an interface for classes that 
           can be configured via the Config system.

    Any object can access the config system, but if an object is to be notified
    of changes made to parameters in the config system that could affect its
    configuration, it should inherit from 'ConfigSystem::Configurable', and use
    'ConfigManager::AddConfigObject(Configurable*)' to add itself to the list
    of objects that the ConfigManager 'manages'.
    The ConfigManager updates the objects it manages on every iteration of the
    see-think thread (updating only those that need updating).
