    @class DarwinWalk
    @brief A module to provide locomotion using Darwin Default walk engine.
 
    The class is responsible for transforming the sensor values retrieved from the NUSensorsData
    instance into sensor values that can be used within the default darwin walk engine.
    These values are applied along with the current walk command and the walk engine generates a set
    of joint targets. These targets are retrived from the walk engine and transformed back into the
    nubots joint space. The targets are then applied to the motors via actions added to the
    NUActionatorsData instance.
