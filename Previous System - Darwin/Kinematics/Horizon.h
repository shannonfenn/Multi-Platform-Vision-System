    @brief Class used to compute and store the horizon line.

    The horizon line is defined as the plane at which the infinite horizon would appear
    in the current image. This is represented by a plane parallel to the ground set
    at the height of the camera. The horizon line shows the line produced by the intersection
    of this plane through the image.
