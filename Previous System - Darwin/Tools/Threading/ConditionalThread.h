    @brief Declaration of (abstract) ConditionalThread class.

    @class ConditionalThread 
    @brief This encapsulates a pthread, provides several additional features.
 
    This particular thread will execute its main loop when it is told to. That is,
    the loop begins when it receives a signal from higher-levels indicating that
    it has a reason to re-run, such as the availability of new data.
