    @brief Declaration of a behaviour provider for vision calibration purposes
 
    @class VisionCalibrationProvider
    @brief A special behaviour for calibrating images.
 
    The chest button is used to start and stop saving images. 
    A short click saves images while rotating exposure, and a long one uses the current settings while saving.
    The left and right buttons scroll through the various motions to perform while saving images.
