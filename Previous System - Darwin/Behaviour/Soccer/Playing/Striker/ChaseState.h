    @brief The chase ball soccer state machine
 
    There are 3 states in this machine
        - GoToBall in this state we move to the ball
        - FindTarget in this state we look for the target to kick the ball to
          This will either be the goal, team mate or open space. If we are well
          localised when entering this state we will transition straight to Kick
        - Kick in this state we kick the ball
 
    If we are not near the ball then we are in the GoToBall state, no exceptions.
    When we reach the ball we transition to the FindTarget state.
    When we have found our target with low enough uncertainity we transition to the Kick state.
