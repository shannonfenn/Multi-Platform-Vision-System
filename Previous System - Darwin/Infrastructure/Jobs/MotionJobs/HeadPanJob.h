    @brief Declaration of HeadPanJob class.
 
    @class HeadPanJob
    @brief A class to encapsulate pan jobs issued for the head module. 
 
    There are three types of pans:
        - Ball --- a pan to just look for the ball
        - BallAndLocalisation --- a pan to both look for the ball and to passively localise
        - Localisation -- a pan just for localisation
    The type specifies (a) default pitch and yaw limits (b) the speed.
