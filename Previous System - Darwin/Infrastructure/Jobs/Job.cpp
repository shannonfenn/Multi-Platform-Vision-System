/*! @brief A helper function to ease writing Job objects to stream.
 
    The idea behind this virtual function is for each child Job to write its
    own data to the stream. Each class level writes the members introduced at that level,
    so that each child's implementation of toStream looks like:
        @code
        Job::toStream(output);
        MotionJob::toStream(output);
        WalkJob::toStream(output);
        WalkToPointJob::toStream(output);
        @endcode
    and so on. I did it this way so I didn't have to write the implementation for the middle levels
    in every child.
 
    @param output the stream to write the job to

/*! @relates Job
    @brief Stream insertion operator for Job.
 
    This operator calls the protected virtual member toStream(output). As toStream is virtual
    the correct toStream function will be called for all types of jobs. Furthermore,
    toStream functions for abstract classes write members introduced at that level of the
    hierachy.

    @param job a pointer to the pointer to the job to store the job extracted from the stream
           (it is done this way to avoid using the assignment operator which I haven't written yet)
 
    @attention This operator needs to be updated when you want to stream a new type of Job.
