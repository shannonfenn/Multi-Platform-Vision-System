    @class NUBlackboard
    @brief A blackboard for storing data that is required by multiple modules.
           The blackboard contains the following containers
                - Sensors; which contains all of the sensor data
                - Actions; which contains all of the actions for the robot's hardware
                - Objects; which contains all of the information about the location of landmarks in the environment
                - Jobs; which contains all of the pending jobs for the robot
                - GameInfo; which contains all of the information about the state of the 'game'
                - TeamInfo; which contains all of the information about the team mates' state
 
    @note Adding a new type of object to the Blackboard is considered a major change, and should be avoided.
